//! buzz-db — Postgres event store for Buzz.
//!
//! ## Design invariants
//! - AUTH events (kind 22242) are never stored — they carry bearer tokens.
//! - Ephemeral events (20000–29999) are never stored — Redis pub/sub only.
//! - Events table is partitioned by month on `created_at`.
//! - No FK references to partitioned tables.
//! - Uses `sqlx::query()` (runtime) not `sqlx::query!()` (compile-time).
//!
//! ## Runtime and store ownership
//! This crate intentionally keeps database runtime and Buzz domain persistence
//! together while maintaining an internal boundary between them:
//!
//! - Runtime concerns own pool construction, writer/replica routing, transaction
//!   creation, session invariants, metrics, and health support.
//! - Store concerns own domain-specific SQL, row mapping, locking, mutation
//!   rules, indexes, and focused persistence tests.
//!
//! Transaction-required store operations accept [`sqlx::Transaction`] so their
//! composition requirement is visible in the type. Private connection helpers
//! are reserved for SQL primitives that are valid on any same-session
//! connection. New domains should prove this boundary incrementally instead of
//! exposing raw pools or introducing broad store traits.
